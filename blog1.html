            <h1>1. A small blog on Let, Const and Var.</h1>

            <p>
                <strong>Let , Const, and Var</strong> are three ways of declaring the
                variables in Javascript. All are similar except for a few differences. I
                will talk about some simple differences below and will tell which is
                more advisable to use.
                <br />

                <strong> Let</strong> - Let was introduced in ES6. It's almost similar
                to Var. It is a modern way of declaring variables the values of which
                are not fixedâ€”and are likely to change in the future. In other words, we
                use let for mutating the variables. In Let, hosting is allowed. Let is a block scope. That means, the
                variable decalraed can be accesssed only within the block ('{}') in which it is declared and within the
                block of its parent element.<br />
                <strong> Const</strong> - Const was also introduced in ES6 along with
                Let. It is also a modern way of declaring the variables. It's used to
                declare variables the values of which are likely to remain fixed in the
                future. For eg, Birthyear. We use const when we are sure that values
                won't change once declared. In Const, hosting is not allowed. Const is also a block scope. <br />
                <strong>Var</strong> - Var is old way of declaring variables. That is,
                prior to ES6, before const and var was introduced. It's pretty similar
                to Let. In Var, hosting is allowed. Unlike Let and Const, Var is a function scope. That means, the
                variable declared with var can be acsessed anywhere within the function in which it is declared. <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Conclusion</strong> - As a best practice, always use const. And if
                you are sure that the value of a variable is going to change in the future
                then use Let. It is a good practice to use as little variable mutations as possible
                because changing variable creates more potential for bugs in the
                code.
